# NowOrNever (Android) — Send Fun Challenges to Friends

**NowOrNever** is a social app to **send and complete challenges with friends**.  
This is the **legacy Android implementation** built with **Clean Architecture**. It still runs and is a good base to revisit, but it needs a modern refactor.

> **Heads-up:** The **Flutter version is better** (newer, cleaner, multi-platform). This Android repo remains as historical/learning material.

## What you can do

- Create and send **challenges** (text, rules, optional deadline).
- Accept/decline, mark as **completed**, and add **proof** (photo/text).
- **Feed** of friends’ activity.
- Lightweight **notifications** (local or FCM-ready).
- Offline-first primitives (queue + retry), limited in the legacy code.
